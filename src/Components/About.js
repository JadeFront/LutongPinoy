            Lutong Pinoy offer unique blends of Spanish, Japanese, Chinese,

                Lutong Pinoy  is simple to cook and always a pleasure to serve 
                and eat. The blend of flavor and texture makes them stand out. 
                Also, the warmth extended to family and friends motivates 
                Filipinos to ‘cook with love.’ The typical Filipino meal is 
                composed of vegetables, seafood, dairy, meat, and rice. In 
                fiestas, food is displayed, in its appetizing and mouth-watering
                 color, in every home as aesthetic. The naturally produced 
                 aroma seduces anyone and traps them in affective means. Its 
                 smell makes it unique because of the secret concoction of 
                 vegetables, herbs, oils, citrus, and spices.
